// Noir is an open-source DSL(Domain specific language) for construction of privacy-preserving zk programs.

// ZK programs are programs that can generate short proof of statements without revealing all inputs to the statements.

// This exercise doesn't do anything yet but it still compiles! Noir file getting run
// needs to have a `main` function. So this file is a valid Noir file.
// Other exercises will require you to write Noir code to make the exercise file compile.
// Remove "I AM NOT DONE" comment when you are ready to move to the next exercise.
