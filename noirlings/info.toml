value of p-1 is multiplication inverse of it self. i.e. (p-1) * (p-1) = 1.
To understand this, you have to first understand the modular arithmetic: c = a +b (mod p)
where `a` and `b` are numbers in the finite field, `c` is the remainder that maps any number >=p and <0 back in the set {0,1,2,...p-1}

The notation 
 means all arithmetic is done modulo p

 for example, for p = 7, 1 = 8 (mod 7)
 0 = 6+1(mod 7)

 0 = p (mod p)

with this lets expand (p-1) * (p-1) = p^2 - 2p + 1 (mod p)
since p mod p is zero we can discard p^2 - 2p
hence (p-1) * (p-1) = 1
